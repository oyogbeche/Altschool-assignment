      <h1>NEVER GIVE UP</h1>
      <p>
        This media page will mostly be based on the principles of Never giving
        up. Because my whole life have been basically been built on this
        foundation. Things pretty much don't always work out immediately or as
        you have planned or envisage it but if you pesevere and never give up
        you will definately get the result you have worked so hard for.

      <p>
        As we all know we can never stop learning, we practically learn new
        things everyday. They is a popular saying by Michael Scott "The day we
        stop learning is the day we die". A key part of personal development is
        being able to learn, unlearn and relearn. In the world of technology
        where new innovations and softwares are being released constantly,
        processes are being updated constantly, if you are not willing to learn,
        unlearn and relearn then you simply cannot cope. I constantly remind
        myself of this and try to live by this principles as well.

      <h2>REPETITION</h2>
      <p>
        Over time I have understood the power of repetition when it comes to
        learning anything. I do by learning and as funny as it sounds, I love it
        when i usually hit a roadblock because it makes me to Keep repetiting
        the process in order to figure out the issue/bug and this allows me the
        opportunity to learn even more new ideas or concepts during this
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repetition is the foundation of mastery. Each time you revisit a
        concept, skill, or practice, you strengthen your understanding, refine
        your technique, and build confidence. It's through repetition that
        knowledge becomes second nature, transforming complex ideas into
        effortless actions. The more you repeat, the more you grow until success
        becomes inevitable. Keep at it, because every repetition is a step
        closer to excellence.
